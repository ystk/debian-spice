Package: spice-client
Architecture: i386 amd64
Depends: ${shlibs:Depends}, ${misc:Depends}
Description: Implements the client side of the SPICE protocol
 The Simple Protocol for Independent Computing Environments (SPICE) is
 a remote display system built for virtual environments which allows
 you to view a computing 'desktop' environment not only on the machine
 where it is running, but from anywhere on the Internet and from a wide
 variety of machine architectures.
 .
 This package contains the SPICE client application.
